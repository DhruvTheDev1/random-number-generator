**Simple Random Number Generator**
This is a simple console-based application that generates a 'random number' based on the users input.
It asks the user for a lower-bound and an upper-bound and then generates a number based on those values (inclusive).

Features:
- Asks user for two inputs: Lower-bound and Upper-bound
- Generates and displays a 'randomly generated number' betweem those values.

Further Work:
- This project is planned to be enhanced and refactored using Spring Boot.
- Will transition from a console-based application to a web application, allowing users to enter the lower/upper bound via a web interface.

Note (extra information):
- Java Random Class is not completely random at all -> It generate pseudo-random numbers.
- It generates sequences in a perfectly predictable way from the seed.
