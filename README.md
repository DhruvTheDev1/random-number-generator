**Random Number Generator (Spring Boot Web App)**

This is a Spring Boot web application that generates a 'random number' based on the users input.
Users can enter a lower-bound and an upper-bound and the application will generate a number within the range inclusive.

Features:
- Built using Spring Boot with Thymeleaf for the front-end.
- Uses Spring Validation to ensure correct user input.
- Generates and displays a 'randomly generated number' within the provided range.

Note (extra information):
- Uses Java's random class which generates pseudo-random numbers.
- It generates sequences in a perfectly predictable way from the seed.
- This web version is refactored from the previous console-based implementation.
- Dependencies (Spring Initializr):
  - Spring Web
  - Thymeleaf
  - Validation

Example:
The application runs on **localhost:8080**
